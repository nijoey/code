Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node. For example, in the following tree, return d.

    a
   / \
  b   c
 /
d

public int maxDepth(TreeNode root){
  if(root==null)
    return 0;
  
  int leftHeight = masDepth(root.left);
  int rightHeight = masDepth(root.right);
  
  int bigger = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
  
  return bigger+1;
}
